Prerequisites
---------------------------

* node v10.0.0
* yarn 1.6.0
* npm 5.6.0
* Chrome 66

You may be able to use newer or older versions of these components, but this is not guaranteed to work.

8. Paste the admin password into the box, and click submit.

An interface will appear, allowing you to control the sources playing on each client individually. If you name the clients using the client name box, the client's settings will be saved to `storage.json` using that name, and will be recalled any time you enter that name, even if you restart the server.
